one day bob had 5 dollars, so he went and bought all the ice cream he could with that money. He then went home and ate all of the ice cream
After finishing the ice cream, Bob wanted more. He needed more! But how could he get more? He was all out of money and wasn't going to get his allowance for another three weeks. What was he to do?
