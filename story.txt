one day bob had 5 dollars, so he went and bought all the ice cream he could with that money. He then went home and ate all of the ice cream
After finishing the ice cream, Bob wanted more. He needed more! But how could he get more? He was all out of money and wasn't going to get his allowance for another three weeks. What was he to do?
Feeling desperate, Bob crept into his parent's room while they were sleep and stole 20 dollars. He was sure he was in the clear. But as he walked to the door he heard footsteps on the stairs behind him.
